<h2>Growing Up</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">I’ve been obsessed with creating games for a while now, starting at age 12 messing around in various game engines. Growing up, I had a diverse range of hobbies, from being a free-lance graphic designer working with clients, video editing fun Youtube videos, to learning 3D animation in elementary school. In my high-school years, I gained a passion for writing, making music, and my favorite of all; programming. While I had a love for each of these hobbies, I spent a lot of my youth confused on which one I should pursue. But that all changed when I started making games. It was art, engineering, sound, design, and writing fused into a single cohesive package the player would experience. It was magic, and the collective whole of everything I loved creating.</p>

<h2>The Present</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">In recent years, I’ve been able to work and grow with incredible developers making games at Revision Interactive, a student team I’ve led various projects with. Working on projects like <i><a href="/Resonance" target="_blank">Resonance</a></i> made me the programmer I am today, and was a driving force in me wanting to become an AI Programmer in the industry. Coordinating with other programmers to architect systems and features has instilled valuable organizational habits.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px"><i><a href="/The-Outreach" target="_blank">The Outreach</a></i> is a much larger project, and has contributed heavily to building my leadership skills. Working with our designer to develop gameplay and AI systems that are easy for them to manipulate, tweak and author has been a deeply satisfying experience that has greatly improved my communication skills. Our team has been short on artists for this project. Working with our artist to make the most of our situation, developing shaders and optimizing assets for efficient use, has strengthened my ability to work under limitations.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px">Being able to share our work with the local game development community and players at events has been deeply fulfilling, and a fantastic environment to learn, grow and network in. Overall, having the opportunity to work and collaborate with people from so many different diciplines is what makes game development so compelling so me.</p>
