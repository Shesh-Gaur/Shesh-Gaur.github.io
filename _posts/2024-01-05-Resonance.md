<h2>Overview</h2>
Game Page: <a href="https://christianmoncada.itch.io/resonance" target="_blank">https://christianmoncada.itch.io/resonance</a>

Resonance is a first-person stealth game set on a grim freighter ship. Avoid sound-oriented creatures by making as little sound as possible and skillfully maneuvering around the ship to avoid confrontation. Use sounds in your environment to distract enemies, and hold your breath to get away unscathed.
