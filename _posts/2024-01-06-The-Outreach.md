The Outreach is a first-person movement shooter with no mechanical weapons. Instead, you wield telekinetic powers to manipulate objects in the environment and defeat hostile alien-built creatures through the depths of an irradiated planet. Centuries after the mysterious extinction of humanity, you are a part of the "Human Restoration Program," the final hope for the rebirth of mankind.
